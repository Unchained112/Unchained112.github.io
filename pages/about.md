# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I just finished my Master's degree in Interactive Media Technology at KTH. I learned about programming and studied computer graphics during my bachelor's and master's education. I love video games and animations, especially in 3D, and I always wish to create one of my own. My project experiences are listed on the Project page. Besides, I like to write blogs to record my technique skill improvement.
