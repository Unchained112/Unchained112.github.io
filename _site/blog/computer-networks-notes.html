<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>A computer network is a system that connects scattered computer systems with independent functions through communication equipment and lines and realizes resource sharing and information transmission by software with complete functions. Roughly speaking, networks can be divided into LANs, MANs, WANs, and internetworks.</p>
<ul>
  <li>LANs (local area network) typical cover a building and operate at high speeds.</li>
  <li>MANs (metropolitan area network) usually cover a city. An example is the cable television system, which is now used by many people to access the Internet.</li>
  <li>WANs (wide area network) may cover a country or a continent. Some of the technologies used to build these networks are point-to-point (e.g., a cable) while others are broadcast (e.g.,wireless).</li>
</ul>

<p>Network software is built around protocols, which are rules by which processes communicate. Most networks support protocol hierarchies, with each layer providing services to the layer above it and insulating them from the details of the
protocols used in the lower layers. Protocol stacks are typically based either on the OSI model or on the TCP/IP model. Both have the link, network, transport, and application layers, but they differ on the other layers. Design issues include reliability, resource allocation, growth, security, and more. Much of this book deals with protocols and their design.</p>

<h2 id="physical-layer">Physical Layer</h2>

<p>The physical layer is the basis of all networks. Nature imposes two fundamental limits on all channels, and these determine their bandwidth. These limits are the <strong>Nyquist limit</strong>, which deals with noiseless channels, and the <strong>Shannon limit</strong>, which deals with noisy channels.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Noiseless Channel : Nyquist Bit Rate</p>

    <p>BitRate = 2 * Bandwidth * log2(L)</p>

    <p>where,L is the number of signal levels used to represent data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Noisy Channel : Shannon Capacity</p>

    <p>Capacity = bandwidth * log2(1 + SNR)</p>

    <p>where, SNR is the signal-to-noise ratio</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Transmission Modes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Simplex Mode: the communication is unidirectional, as on a one-way street.Only one of the two devices on a link can transmit, the other can only receive.</li>
  <li>Half-duplex Mode: each station can both transmit and receive, but not at the same time.</li>
  <li>Full-duplex Mode: both stations can transmit and receive simultaneously.</li>
</ul>

<p>Manchester Encoding: When there is a long sequence of 0s and 1s, there is a problem at the receiving end. The problem is that the synchronization is lost due to lack of transmissions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>NRZ-level encoding : The polarity of signals changes when incoming signal changes from ‘1’ to ‘0’ or from ‘0’ to ‘1’. It considers the first bit data as polarity change.</li>
  <li>NRZ-Inverted/ Differential encoding:In this, the transitions at the beginning of bit interval is equal to 1 and if there is no transition at the beginning of bit interval is equal to 0.</li>
</ul>

<p>Transmission media can be guided or unguided. The principal guided media are twisted pair, coaxial cable, and fiber optics. Unguided media include terrestrial radio, microwaves, infrared, lasers through the air, and satellite.</p>

<h2 id="data-link-layer">Data Link Layer</h2>

<p>The task of the data link layer is to convert the raw bit stream offered by the physical layer into a stream of frames for use by the network layer. The link layer can present this stream with varying levels of reliability, ranging from connectionless, unacknowledged service to reliable, connection-oriented service.</p>

<h3 id="framing">Framing</h3>

<p>It provides a way for a sender to transmit a set of bits that are meaningful to the receiver.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Character/Byte Stuffing: Used when frames consist of character. If data contains ED then, byte is stuffed into data to differentiate it from ED.</li>
  <li>Bit stuffing: Sender stuffs a bit to break the pattern i.e. here appends a 0 in data = 011101.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="error-control">Error Control</h3>

<p>Network designers have developed two basic strategies for dealing with errors. Both add redundant information to the data that is sent.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Error-correcting codes: include enough redundant information to enable the receiver to deduce what the transmitted data must have been.
    <ol>
      <li>Hamming codes.</li>
      <li>Binary convolutional codes.</li>
      <li>Reed-Solomon codes.</li>
      <li>Low-Density Parity Check codes.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Error-detecting codes: other is to include only enough redundancy to allow the receiver to deduce that an error has occurred (but not which error)
    <ol>
      <li>Parity.</li>
      <li>Checksums.</li>
      <li>Cyclic Redundancy Checks (CRCs).</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="flow-control">Flow Control</h3>

<p>Flow control is to match the sending speed and receiving speed during the transmission process, reducing transmission errors and resource waste.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/NetworkNotes/FlowControl.jpeg" alt="Flow Control" /></p>

<h3 id="media-access-control">Media Access Control</h3>

<p>Channelization Protocol: FDMA; TDMA; CDMA; WDMA.</p>

<p>Random Access Protocol</p>
<ul>
  <li>ALOHA</li>
  <li>CSMA (carrier sense multiple access)</li>
  <li>CSMA/CD (carrier sense multiple access with collision detection)</li>
  <li>CSMA/CA (carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance)</li>
</ul>

<p>Those carrier sensing techniques have led to a variety of CSMA protocols for LANs and MANs. It is the basis for classic Ethernet and 802.11 networks. In the dominant wireless LAN, <strong>IEEE 802.11</strong>, stations use CSMA/CA to mitigate the first problem by leaving small gaps to avoid collisions.</p>

<p>Controlled Access Protocol</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reservation</li>
  <li>Rolling</li>
  <li>Token Passing</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Ethernet</strong> is the dominant form of wired LAN. Classic Ethernet used CSMA/CD for channel allocation on a yellow cable the size of a garden hose that snaked from machine to machine. The architecture has changed as speeds have risen from 10 Mbps to 10 Gbps and continue to climb. Now, point-to-point links such as twisted pair are attached to hubs and switches. With modern switches and full-duplex links, there is no contention on the links and the switch can forward frames between different ports in parallel.</p>

<h2 id="network-layer">Network Layer</h2>

<p>The network layer provides services to the transport layer. It can be based on either datagrams or virtual circuits. In both cases, its main job is routing packets from the source to the destination. In datagram networks, a routing decision is made on every packet. In virtual-circuit networks, it is made when the virtual circuit is set up.</p>

<p>The glue that holds the whole Internet together is the network layer protocol, <strong>IP (Internet Protocol)</strong>. Communication in the Internet works as follows. The transport layer takes data streams and breaks them up so that they may be sent as IP packets. In theory, packets can be up to 64 KB each, but in practice they are usually not more than 1500 bytes (so they fit in one Ethernet frame). IP routers forward each packet through the Internet, along a path from one router to the next, until the destination
is reached. At the destination, the network layer hands the data to the transport layer, which gives it to the receiving process. When all the pieces finally get to the destination machine, they are reassembled by the network layer into the original datagram.</p>

<p>The IPv6 header</p>

<p><img src="/assets/NetworkNotes/IPV6.png" alt="IPV6" /></p>

<p><strong>Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)</strong>: Since IP does not have a inbuilt mechanism for sending error and control messages. It depends on Internet Control Message Protocol(ICMP) to provide an error control.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Source quench message</li>
  <li>Parameter problem</li>
  <li>Time exceeded message</li>
  <li>Destination un-reachable</li>
</ol>

<p>The main routing protocols used within networks are OSPF and RIP, and the routing protocol used across networks is BGP.</p>

<p><strong>Open shortest path first (OSPF)</strong> uses a <strong>Link State Routing (LSR)</strong> algorithm and falls into the group of interior gateway protocols (IGPs), operating within a single autonomous system (AS).</p>

<p>OSPF gathers link state information from available routers and constructs a topology map of the network. The topology is presented as a routing table to the Internet Layer for routing packets by their destination IP address. OSPF supports Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4) and Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) networks and supports the Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) addressing model.</p>

<p><strong>Routing Information Protocol(RIP)</strong> is a dynamic routing protocol which uses hop count as a routing metric to find the best path between the source and the destination network. It is a <strong>Distance Vector Routing (DVR)</strong> protocol which has AD value 120 and works on the application layer of OSI model. RIP uses port number 520.</p>

<p>Hop Count:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Hop count is the number of routers occurring in between the source and destination network. The path with the lowest hop count is considered as the best route to reach a network and therefore placed in the routing table.</li>
  <li>The maximum hop count allowed for RIP is 15 and hop count of 16 is considered as network unreachable.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Border gateway protocol (BGP)</strong>: is a standardized exterior gateway protocol designed to exchange routing and reachability information among autonomous systems (AS) on the Internet. BGP is classified as a path-vector routing protocol, and it makes routing decisions based on paths, network policies, or rule-sets configured by a network administrator.</p>
